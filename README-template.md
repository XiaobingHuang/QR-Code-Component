### What I learned

This project was a great practice in using CSS Flexbox for layout and ensuring responsive design. I practiced using Flexbox properties like `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `flex-direction` to center elements both vertically and horizontally. Additionally, I used `rem` and `vh` units to maintain responsiveness across devices, enhancing accessibility and scalability.
